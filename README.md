Advanced DNA Sequence Analysis and Alignment Toolkit
A sophisticated implementation of DNA sequence analysis algorithms focusing on alignment optimization and pattern matching. The project integrates multiple advanced bioinformatics techniques: modified Smith-Waterman algorithm with gap penalties, Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) for efficient pattern matching, and hybrid sequence alignment with compression.
The toolkit features intelligent gap penalty management, distinguishing between isolated and consecutive gaps for more biologically relevant alignments. The hybrid alignment algorithm incorporates customizable scoring parameters for match gains and mismatch penalties, while the BWT implementation enables efficient exact pattern matching through suffix array optimization.
Key functionalities include:

Enhanced edit distance calculation with adaptive gap penalties
Hybrid sequence alignment with traceback matrix implementation
BWT-based pattern matching with last-to-first mapping
Compressed sequence alignment using Smith-Waterman algorithm
Comprehensive output visualization of alignment scores and matched patterns

The implementation emphasizes computational efficiency while maintaining biological relevance, making it suitable for both research and educational purposes in computational biology and bioinformatics.
